## Summary of Findings


### 1. What is a carbon credit and how does it work?

#### Key Concepts
- One credit permits the emission of a mass equal to one ton of carbon dioxide.
- Once the carbon credit is used to offset a ton of CO2, it is considered 'retired'.

#### Answer ChatGPT4

A carbon credit is a permit or certificate that allows the holder to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. The idea is to reduce the emission of these gases into the atmosphere, which are a major cause of global warming. One credit permits the emission of a mass equal to one ton of carbon dioxide.

The concept of carbon credits came into existence as a result of increasing awareness of the need for controlling emissions. It was formalized in the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement between more than 170 countries, and the market mechanisms were outlined in the Marrakech Accords.

Here's how it works:

    Setting Emission Caps: A central authority (usually a governmental body) sets a limit or cap on the amount of a pollutant that can be emitted. This limit is allocated or sold to firms in the form of emissions permits which represent the right to emit or discharge a specific volume of the specified pollutant.

    Trading: Firms that need to increase their volume of emissions must buy credits from those who pollute less. In effect, the buyer is paying a charge for polluting, while the seller is being rewarded for having reduced emissions. Thus, in theory, those who can reduce emissions most cheaply will do so, achieving the pollution reduction at the lowest cost to society.

    Offsetting: Carbon offsetting has gained popularity as individuals, companies, or countries that cannot reduce their own emissions can offset their emissions by purchasing carbon credits from elsewhere. For example, a company could offset its emissions by investing in a project that leads to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, like a renewable energy or reforestation project.

    Verification: To ensure that all carbon credits are valid and that projects are delivering what they promise, independent third-party verification bodies are used. These bodies assess the projects and their impact.

    Retirement: Once the carbon credit is used to offset a ton of CO2, it is considered 'retired'. It cannot be sold again. The retirement ensures that each ton of emissions is offset once and only once.

The goal of carbon credits is to reduce the cost of meeting a given emissions target by giving those who can achieve reductions less expensively the opportunity to sell excess reductions (i.e., reductions in excess of those required by their own emissions cap) to those who face higher costs. This leads to a more cost-effective total reduction in emissions.

### 2. What are the different types of carbon credits?

#### Key Concepts
- Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
- Emission Reduction Units (ERUs) under Joint Implementation (JI) mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol
- Assigned Amount Units (AAUs)
- Voluntary Emission Reductions (VERs)
- Carbon Offsets

#### Answer ChatGPT4

There are several types of carbon credits, each with its own specific characteristics and uses. Here are some of the most common types:

    Certified Emission Reductions (CERs): These are issued by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). CERs are generated by climate change mitigation projects in developing countries. Each CER represents the successful reduction or avoidance of one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e).

    Emission Reduction Units (ERUs): These are generated by projects in industrialized countries that reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Joint Implementation (JI) mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. Like CERs, each ERU represents one tonne of CO2e reduced or avoided.

    Removal Units (RMUs): These are issued for activities that remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, such as afforestation and reforestation.

    Verified Emission Reductions (VERs): These are generated by projects that reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions and are verified by independent third parties. VERs are often used by companies and individuals to offset their own emissions on a voluntary basis.

    Assigned Amount Units (AAUs): These are issued to countries under the Kyoto Protocol, representing the right to emit a certain amount of greenhouse gases. Countries that emit less than their assigned amount can sell their excess AAUs to countries that emit more.

    Voluntary Emission Reductions (VERs): These are similar to CERs but are not part of the UNFCCC's regulated framework. Instead, they are part of the voluntary carbon market where companies, individuals, and governments voluntarily purchase carbon credits to offset their own carbon emissions.

    Carbon Offsets: These are a form of trade. When you buy an offset, you fund projects that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Each type of carbon credit operates within a specific regulatory framework, and the choice of which type to use depends on the specific needs and goals of the entity seeking to offset its emissions.

### 3. What is the current state and future prospects of the carbon credit market?


Here are some recent papers that discuss the current state and future prospects of the carbon credit market:

    "Biodiversity and REDD at Copenhagen" (2009): This paper discusses the potential of the REDD (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) mechanism to reduce carbon emissions caused by deforestation. It suggests that the success of this mechanism will depend on the implementation of sensible policies by countries. Full Text

    "Power and Carbon Sovereignty in a Non-Traditional Capitalist State: Discourses of Carbon Trading in China" (2015): This paper explores the emergence of carbon markets in China, a non-traditional capitalist economy. It discusses the challenges and potential of establishing an emissions trading scheme (ETS) in China. Full Text

    "Assessing the Potential to Reduce U.S. Building CO2 Emissions 80% by 2050" (2019): This paper uses a model of U.S. building energy use to assess the potential for the U.S. buildings sector to reduce CO2 emissions 80% by 2050. It suggests that a combination of aggressive efficiency measures, electrification, and high renewable energy penetration can achieve this goal. Full Text

    "The US Ethanol and Biofuels Boom: Its Origins, Current Status, and Future Prospects" (2008): This paper discusses the boom in ethanol and other biofuels in the U.S., its origins, current status, and future prospects under different policy regimes.

### 4. Who are the major buyers and sellers of carbon credits?

The buyers and sellers of carbon credits are typically entities that emit greenhouse gases and are looking to offset their emissions, and entities that can reduce or remove greenhouse gases and are looking to monetize these reductions or removals. Here are some examples:

Buyers of Carbon Credits:

    Corporations: Many large corporations buy carbon credits as part of their sustainability initiatives. This can help them offset their own emissions and meet their corporate social responsibility goals. Examples include Microsoft, Google, and Shell.

    Governments: Some national and subnational governments buy carbon credits to meet their emissions reduction targets under international agreements like the Paris Agreement.

    Individuals: Some individuals buy carbon credits to offset their personal carbon footprint, such as from flying or driving.

Sellers of Carbon Credits:

    Renewable Energy Projects: Projects that generate energy from renewable sources, like wind or solar power, can sell carbon credits based on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions they prevent compared to fossil fuel-based energy sources.

    Forestry and Land Use Projects: Projects that reduce deforestation or promote reforestation can sell carbon credits based on the amount of carbon dioxide that trees absorb from the atmosphere.

    Industrial and Agricultural Projects: Projects that reduce emissions from industrial or agricultural processes, such as by capturing and utilizing methane from landfills or livestock, can sell carbon credits based on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions they prevent.

    Carbon Capture and Storage Projects: Projects that capture and store carbon dioxide emissions, such as from power plants or industrial facilities, can sell carbon credits based on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions they prevent from entering the atmosphere.

It's important to note that the carbon credit market is regulated by various international, national, and subnational entities, and the eligibility of buyers and sellers can vary depending on the specific regulations.

### 5. How are carbon credit prices determined?

The price of carbon credits is determined by a variety of factors, including supply and demand, the cost of reducing emissions, and the regulatory environment. Here's a closer look at these factors:

    Supply and Demand: Like any market, the price of carbon credits is heavily influenced by supply and demand. If there are many sellers but few buyers, the price will likely be lower. Conversely, if there are many buyers but few sellers, the price will likely be higher.

    Cost of Reducing Emissions: The cost of reducing emissions can also influence the price of carbon credits. If it's expensive to reduce emissions, sellers will want to charge a higher price for their credits. If it's cheap to reduce emissions, sellers may be willing to accept a lower price.

    Regulatory Environment: The regulatory environment can have a big impact on the price of carbon credits. For example, if a government imposes strict emissions limits, the demand for carbon credits may increase, driving up the price. On the other hand, if a government provides subsidies for emissions reductions, the supply of carbon credits may increase, potentially driving down the price.

    Quality of the Credits: The quality of the credits can also affect their price. Credits from projects that have a high environmental impact and strong social benefits, and that are verified by reputable third parties, may command a higher price.

    Market Mechanisms: In some cases, the price of carbon credits is determined by market mechanisms such as carbon trading exchanges. These exchanges operate in a similar way to stock exchanges, with buyers and sellers trading credits and the price fluctuating based on supply and demand.

It's worth noting that the price of carbon credits can vary widely, from a few dollars to over $50 per tonne of CO2 equivalent, reflecting these different factors.

Yes, there are several well-known international agreements and certificates related to carbon credits:

    Kyoto Protocol: This international treaty, which extends the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), commits state parties to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Kyoto Protocol introduced three market-based mechanisms to assist countries in meeting their emission reduction targets, namely Emissions Trading, Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and Joint Implementation (JI).

    Clean Development Mechanism (CDM): The CDM allows a country with an emission-reduction or emission-limitation commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to implement an emission-reduction project in developing countries. Such projects can earn saleable certified emission reduction (CER) credits, each equivalent to one tonne of CO2, which can be counted towards meeting Kyoto targets.

    Joint Implementation (JI): Under JI, a developed country with relatively high costs of domestic greenhouse reduction would set up a project in another developed country.

    Emission Reduction Units (ERUs): These are carbon credits issued for emission reductions achieved by JI projects.

    Certified Emission Reductions (CERs): These are issued by the CDM Executive Board for emission reductions achieved by CDM projects and verified by a DOE (Designated Operational Entities) under the rules of the Kyoto Protocol.

    Paris Agreement: This is a legally binding international treaty on climate change, adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, in 2015. Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. While it doesn't directly establish a carbon credit system, it lays the groundwork for a new international carbon market mechanism.

    Gold Standard: This is a certification standard for carbon offset projects, provided by the Gold Standard Foundation. It ensures that carbon credits are not only real and verifiable but that they also make measurable contributions to sustainable development worldwide.

    Verified Carbon Standard (VCS): This is the world’s most widely used voluntary GHG program. Projects using the VCS Standard must follow a rigorous assessment process to ensure they are reducing or removing GHG emissions following the rules set out in the VCS Standard.

These mechanisms and standards are designed to ensure the integrity of carbon credits and the effectiveness of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
