I want to conduct a study, together with two envieronmental cientists, on the feasibility of making a startup dedicating to capturing and selling carbon credits.

For this study, I want to study 5 different key areas related to the creation, measurement, registration and comercialization of carbon credits, considering existing companies, ngos and government agencies.

The study will be carried out over 5 weeks. Each week we will spend one hour in meeting and one our each of us studing the topic on our own. During the meeting we will sumarize our findings of the previous week and plan the research for the next week.

Please identify the 5 areas of study, one for each week, and give me a set of questions for us to investigate each area each week.

My goal is that, at the end of the 5 weeks we will have all relevant information to start our own carbon credit capturing and selling company. Or, at least, understand what other things need to be considered before doing this.

Sure, I'll list the five areas you could focus on, each week, and also provide some pertinent questions that you could use to guide your investigation:

Week 1: Understanding Carbon Credits and Their Market

Study the basic concept of carbon credits, its purpose and importance, how it works, the types of carbon credits, and their current market trends.

Questions to investigate:

    What is a carbon credit and how does it work?
    What are the different types of carbon credits?
    What is the current state and future prospects of the carbon credit market?
    Who are the major buyers and sellers of carbon credits?
    How are carbon credit prices determined?

Week 2: Legal and Regulatory Framework

Investigate the legal and regulatory aspects of carbon credits. This would involve understanding international, national, and local laws and regulations concerning carbon credits.

Questions to investigate:

    What are the international laws and agreements concerning carbon credits?
    How do different countries regulate carbon credits?
    Are there any specific laws or regulations concerning carbon credits in our target geographical area?
    What are the requirements and processes for certification and verification of carbon credits?
    What potential legal issues could arise when dealing with carbon credits?

Week 3: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Technologies

Explore the current technologies used in capturing and storing carbon. This would involve understanding their cost, efficiency, reliability, and environmental impact.

Questions to investigate:

    What are the currently available carbon capture and storage technologies?
    What are their costs, efficiencies, reliability, and environmental impacts?
    What new technologies are being developed?
    What are the challenges and opportunities in this area?
    What resources (human, capital, etc.) would we need to implement these technologies?

Week 4: Carbon Credit Verification and Certification

Understand the process and requirements for carbon credit verification and certification. This would involve studying different certification standards and organizations.

Questions to investigate:

    What are the processes and requirements for carbon credit verification and certification?
    What are the major certification standards and organizations?
    How do these organizations audit and certify carbon credits?
    What are the costs and timelines associated with this process?
    How does the certification process impact the value of carbon credits?

Week 5: Business Model and Strategy

Develop a business model for the startup. Understand the potential revenue streams, costs, profitability, and risks. Also, study existing companies in this sector to understand their strategies and business models.

Questions to investigate:

    What are the potential revenue streams for our startup?
    What are the expected costs (start-up and operational)?
    What could be our potential profitability and break-even point?
    What risks should we consider and how can we mitigate them?
    What strategies and business models have existing companies in this sector used?

This schedule should help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the carbon credit market, legalities, technology, certification process, and business aspects, thus enabling you to make informed decisions on the feasibility of your startup.

If I were to conduct this study and save its results on a github repo. Give me an appropiate name for the repo, a README.md file with the areas of study that you mentioned before, and a folder structure where to save all relevant data of each area.

Please provide additional templates for readme files for each area if necessary.
ChatGPT

Sure, I'd be happy to help with that.

First, for the GitHub repository, a name like CarbonCreditsStartupStudy could be suitable, it's concise and descriptive about the purpose of the repo.

Now, for the README.md in the root of the repo:

# Carbon Credits Startup Feasibility Study

This repository contains all the relevant research data and findings of our feasibility study for a startup dedicated to capturing and selling carbon credits. The study is divided into five key areas:

1. Understanding Carbon Credits and Their Market
2. Legal and Regulatory Framework
3. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Technologies
4. Carbon Credit Verification and Certification
5. Business Model and Strategy

Each area of study includes a summary of findings, relevant research documents, and useful resources.

For the folder structure, you might have something like:

/
├── README.md
├── Week1_Understanding_Carbon_Credits_and_Their_Market
│   ├── README.md
│   └── resources
├── Week2_Legal_and_Regulatory_Framework
│   ├── README.md
│   └── resources
├── Week3_CCS_Technologies
│   ├── README.md

├── Week4_Carbon_Credit_Verification_and_Certification
│   ├── README.md
│   └── resources
└── Week5_Business_Model_and_Strategy
    ├── README.md
    └── resources

Each README.md in each week's folder might look something like:

I want to create five folder in my github repo for these five areas of study. Give me names for these folders, take into account the naming conventions of the github repos with most stars.

1. Understanding Carbon Credits and Their Market
2. Legal and Regulatory Framework
3. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Technologies
4. Carbon Credit Verification and Certification
5. Business Model and Strategy
ChatGPT

When considering the naming conventions for folders in popular GitHub repositories, it's important to remember that simplicity, clarity, and conciseness are key. Most folders tend to use hyphen-separated words, and all lowercase. Based on this, the following could be suitable names for your folders:

    carbon-credits-market
    legal-regulatory-framework
    ccs-technologies
    carbon-credit-certification
    business-model-strategy

Remember to keep the names clear and descriptive to allow other contributors to understand their contents easily.
